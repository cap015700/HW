					<p><center><em>The scatterplot above represents the correlation of two different income populations and their respective
					   relationships with the percentage of the populations which have been told they suffer from depression. The
					   first income population (%Single and Rich) shows the percentage of people, by state, who are single and made
					   more $200,000 in the last 12 months. The second income population (%Poor with Family) represents the percentage of
					   the popluation, by state, who had families and made less than $10,000 in the the 12 last months. Both datasets are
					   are plotted against the y axis which represents the percentage of state populations that have been told they were
					   depressed. According the data analysis, there doesn't seem to be any definitive correlation to between either
					   income poplulations and the percentage of people who had been told they were depressed. The first income population
					   (%Single and Rich) had a correlation coefficient of (-.36668) and the second income population (%Poor with Family)
					   had a correlation coefficient of (.0215). Neither coefficients are sufficient to support a determination based solely
					   on these factors. It is important to note that the correlation of (%Single and Rich) is 17 times greater than the 
					   correlation of (%Poor with Family). Also, the negative correlation of the (%Single and Rich) population indicates
					   that the percentage of people who have been told that they were depressed decreases as the percentage of the population
					   that is single and rich increases. Conversely, the (%Poor with Family) population has a positive correlation albeit
					   negligible at (.0215). Also, Puerto Rico had the greatest percentage of families (13.3%) making less than $10,000 with
					   the percentage depressed at (18.5%), and the District of Columbia had the greatest percentage (8.4%) of single households
					   making more than $200,000 with percentage depressed at (18.1%). Based on our findings in this analysis is indeterminate
					   as to whether or not income levels are related to depression amongst the populations. Of course, there are innumerable
					   other socieconomic factors that could affect the percentage of the population that has been told they have forms of 
					   depression. This is simply a preliminary analysis to find the correlations, if any, of these two particular factors.
