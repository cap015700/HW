## WeatherPy

In this example, I created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ random (non-repeat) cities across the world of varying distance from the equator by utilizing a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

The objective is to build a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Languages and Tools: 

* You must use the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
* You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data. 
* You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
* You must include an exported markdown version of your Notebook called  `README.md` in your GitHub repository.  
* See [Example Solution](WeatherPy_Example.pdf) for a reference on expected format.
